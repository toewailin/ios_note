Here’s the improved guide that includes checking if the `ios` folder exists and generating it if needed. This ensures that the steps are more comprehensive and cover scenarios where the folder might not yet exist.

### **How to Build and Run the Financial-Tracker-App in Xcode (iOS)**

This guide assumes the project is a React Native or Expo project based on the structure shared.

---

### **1. Install Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the required tools installed on your macOS system:

- **Node.js**: Install it via [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) or Homebrew:
  ```bash
  brew install node
  ```

- **Xcode**: Install it from the Mac App Store.

- **CocoaPods**: Install it via Homebrew:
  ```bash
  brew install cocoapods
  ```

- **Expo CLI (optional, for Expo projects)**:
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```

---

### **2. Clone the Repository**

Clone the project and navigate to its directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KoPyae2/Financial-Tracker-App.git
cd Financial-Tracker-App
```

---

### **3. Install Dependencies**

Install the project dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn install
```

---

### **4. Check if the `ios` Folder Exists**

The `ios` folder is required for building the iOS app. Check if it exists:

```bash
ls ios
```

#### **If the `ios` Folder Exists:**
- Proceed to Step 5 to install the iOS dependencies.

#### **If the `ios` Folder Does NOT Exist:**
1. Generate the `ios` folder by initializing the iOS platform for React Native:
   ```bash
   npx react-native init-ios
   ```
   Or, if the project is using **Expo**, eject the project to add native iOS and Android folders:
   ```bash
   expo eject
   ```

   This will create the necessary `ios` folder and native project files.

2. Once the `ios` folder is generated, proceed to Step 5.

---

### **5. Install iOS Dependencies with CocoaPods**

Navigate to the `ios` folder and install CocoaPods dependencies:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

---

### **6. Check if the Project Uses Expo**

- If the project uses Expo, follow Step 7 to run it directly using the Expo CLI.
- If the project uses React Native CLI, skip to Step 8 for Xcode instructions.

---

### **7. Run the Project Using Expo (If Applicable)**

If the project uses Expo, you don’t need to open Xcode manually. Instead, run the following commands:

1. Start the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

2. Open the app in the iOS simulator:
   ```bash
   expo start --ios
   ```

3. Alternatively, scan the QR code that appears in the terminal using the **Expo Go** app on your iPhone.

---

### **8. Open the Project in Xcode**

If the project uses React Native CLI, follow these steps:

#### 8.1 Open the `.xcworkspace` File

Navigate to the `ios` folder and open the `.xcworkspace` file using Xcode:

```bash
cd ios
open FinancialTrackerApp.xcworkspace
```

> **Note:** Always open the `.xcworkspace` file, not the `.xcodeproj` file. The `.xcworkspace` file includes all CocoaPods dependencies.

---

### **9. Configure Xcode**

#### 9.1 Configure Signing & Capabilities
- Go to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab in Xcode.
- Select your Apple Developer account under the "Team" field.
- Ensure the **Bundle Identifier** is unique (e.g., `com.yourname.financialtracker`).

#### 9.2 Select a Simulator or Device
- In the Xcode toolbar, select a target device (e.g., iPhone 14 simulator or a connected iPhone).

---

### **10. Run the App**

Click the "Play" button (`Cmd + R`) in Xcode to build and run the app.

---

### **11. Start Metro Bundler**

The Metro Bundler must be running to serve the app’s JavaScript files.

Start it in a new terminal window:

```bash
npm start
```

This ensures the app fetches JavaScript files and assets.

---

### **12. Handle Errors**

If you encounter issues during the build or runtime, check:

- **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install` and `pod install`).
- **iOS Deployment Target**: Ensure the iOS deployment target in Xcode matches the required version for your app.
- **Xcode Logs**: Check the Xcode console for error messages and follow the suggestions to fix them.

---

### **13. Additional Configuration for TailwindCSS and TypeScript**

- **TailwindCSS**: Ensure the `tailwind.config.js` and `global.css` files are configured properly for styling components.
- **TypeScript**: Check the `tsconfig.json` file to ensure the correct settings for TypeScript in React Native.

---

### **14. Test on Device or Simulator**

After successfully building the app, test it on the simulator or a physical device to verify functionality.

---

### **Summary**

1. **Check for Prerequisites**: Ensure Node.js, Xcode, and CocoaPods are installed.
2. **Clone the Repo**: `git clone https://github.com/KoPyae2/Financial-Tracker-App.git`.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` and `pod install` (if the `ios` folder exists).
4. **Generate iOS Folder**: If the `ios` folder is missing, generate it using `npx react-native init-ios` or `expo eject`.
5. **Run with Xcode**: Open `FinancialTrackerApp.xcworkspace` and build/run the app (`Cmd + R`).
